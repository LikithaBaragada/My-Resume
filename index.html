    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Novel Energy Efficient data and Privacy-Preserving aggregation algorithm </h3>

            <p>Proposed an algorithm which significantly reduces the energy consumption through decreasing the redundant data sensed by sensors and privacy preserving as the algorithm uses data slicing technology & fake fragments. Caching technique for an existing algorithm known as Chain-based data aggregation is proposed.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Information Retrieval and Web Search Project</h3>
            <p>Designed a code using Python coding language to distinguish between spam messages and ham messages by training and testing data. In which dataset consists of spam messages, these messages are labeled as “spam” or “ham”. Implemented spam detection using Bayes’ probability theorem.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Home Automation and Security using IoT</h3>
            <p>An Android app is designed using Java and XML such that it acts as a transmitter to control the appliances via ThingSpeak and to monitor the camera using Livestream. NodeMCU and RaspberryPi are used to control the Hardware. A simple server (Dataplicity) is established on the RaspberryPi to upload the live stream into a webpage.</p>
